[00:27.54] See them fall
[00:34.28] Rained down now
[00:41.04] See them cry
[00:47.18] You know you should trust me
[01:01.18] 
[00:55.04] Cross the line
[01:01.64] Rain fall down
[01:08.59] Clown sad tears
[01:14.59] They are up to here
[01:24.09] 
[01:26.05] And you will never be alone
[01:39.55] 
[02:45.74] Feel them bathe
[02:51.31] With rainfall down
[02:58.23] The guilt in me
[03:05.36] Is sung in need
